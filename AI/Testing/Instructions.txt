WSL Python OpenCV AI Project: Setup, Usage, and Troubleshooting
============================================================

1. Project Setup
----------------

1. Open your WSL terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
	  cd /mnt/c/Users/{your-user-name}/path-to-file/Git/fa25-prime-directive/AI
3. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
	  python3 -m venv venv
	  source venv/bin/activate
4. Install OpenCV and NumPy:
	  pip install opencv-python numpy
   - If you see an "externally-managed-environment" error, use:
	  pip install --break-system-packages opencv-python numpy
5. (Optional) Install additional AI libraries:
	  pip install tensorflow torch torchvision scikit-learn

2. Running test.py
------------------

1. (Optional) Activate your virtual environment:
	  source venv/bin/activate
2. Run the test.py script:
	  python3 Testing/test.py
   - This will process the image and save the output as Testing/output.jpg.
   - Python scripts do not need to be compiled; just run them directly.

3. Example Scripts
------------------

**Basic OpenCV Test (headless, WSL-friendly):**

	import cv2
	img = cv2.imread('Testing/path_to_image.jpeg')
	if img is not None:
		cv2.imwrite('Testing/output.jpg', img)
		print('Image saved as Testing/output.jpg')
	else:
		print('Error: Image not found or path is incorrect.')

**Face Detection Example:**

	import cv2
	face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
	img = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')
	gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
	faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)
	for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
		cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)
	# For WSL, save result instead of imshow:
	cv2.imwrite('Testing/faces_output.jpg', img)
	print('Faces image saved as Testing/faces_output.jpg')

4. WSL OpenCV GUI (cv2.imshow) Troubleshooting
----------------------------------------------

If you get errors like:
	qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display :0
	This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized.

This means OpenCV's GUI functions (like cv2.imshow) require an X server (graphical environment) to display windows, which is not available by default in WSL.

**To fix:**
1. Install an X server on Windows (e.g., VcXsrv or Xming).
   - Download VcXsrv: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
2. Start the X server on Windows before running your script.
3. In your WSL terminal, set the DISPLAY variable to your Windows host IP:
	  export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0
4. Run your script again:
	  python3 Testing/test.py

**Tips:**
- Make sure the X server is running and not blocked by a firewall.
- When starting VcXsrv, check "Disable access control" to allow connections.

**Headless alternative:**
If you do not need to display images, you can save them to a file and view them in Windows (see example above).

5. Troubleshooting: Externally Managed Environment & Package Conflicts
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you see an error like:
	error: externally-managed-environment

This means your Python environment is managed by the OS and restricts pip installs. To work around this:

1. **If using a virtual environment (recommended):**
	  source venv/bin/activate
   - If you still see the error, use pip with the --break-system-packages flag:
	  pip install --break-system-packages opencv-python numpy

2. **If you get version conflicts (e.g., numpy and scipy):**
   - If you see a conflict between opencv-python and scipy over numpy version:
		- opencv-python 4.12.0.88 requires numpy >=2 and <2.3.0 (for Python 3.9+)
		- scipy 1.11.4 requires numpy <1.28.0
   - There is no single numpy version that satisfies both. You have two options:
		1. Downgrade opencv-python to a version compatible with numpy 1.26.4:
			 pip install --break-system-packages 'opencv-python<4.7.0.72' numpy==1.26.4
		2. Or, if you need a newer opencv-python, consider updating/downgrading scipy to a version compatible with numpy >=2.
   - Choose the combination that fits your project needs.

3. **If you see warnings about ~/.local/bin not being on PATH:**
   - Add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
		export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   - Then run:
		source ~/.bashrc

4. **If problems persist:**
   - Delete and recreate your virtual environment:
		deactivate
		rm -rf venv
		python3 -m venv venv
		source venv/bin/activate
		pip install --break-system-packages opencv-python numpy

Running the Face Detection Script (Windows)
==========================================

The face_detect.py script detects faces in images and draws rectangles around them.

Prerequisites:
- Virtual environment activated with OpenCV installed
- An image to process (can be captured with the webcam scripts)

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. Capture an image with your face (optional, if you haven't already):
   ```powershell
   python ".\Using Webcam in WSL\captureimage.py"
   ```

3. Run the face detection script:
   ```powershell
   python ".\Testing\face_detect.py"
   ```

The script will:
- Look for an image from your webcam capture
- Detect faces in the image
- Draw blue rectangles around detected faces
- Save the result as Testing/faces_output.jpg
- Print how many faces were found

Requirements:
Make sure you have OpenCV installed in your virtual environment:
```powershell
pip install opencv-python
```

Troubleshooting:
- If you get "No image found", run the webcam capture script first
- If the script crashes, ensure your virtual environment is activated and OpenCV is installed
- The output image will be saved in the Testing folder
